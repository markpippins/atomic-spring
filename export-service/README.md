# Export Service

The export service module for the Nucleus system, responsible for handling data export operations and generating various output formats.

## Overview

The export service provides functionality for exporting data from the system in various formats including CSV, JSON, XML, and other structured formats. It integrates with the broker system to receive export requests and processes them according to specified parameters.

## Key Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Export data in various formats (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.)
- **Filtering and Transformation**: Apply filters and transformations during export
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large data exports efficiently
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Support for long-running export operations
- **Export History**: Track and manage export request history
- **Security**: Enforce access controls on export operations

## Architecture

The export service includes:

- **ExportController**: REST endpoints for receiving export requests
- **ExportService**: Core business logic for export operations
- **ExportProcessor**: Handles the actual data export process
- **FormatHandlers**: Specialized handlers for different export formats
- **ExportRepository**: Stores export request metadata and history

## API

The service handles requests through the broker system with operations including:

- `exportData`: Main operation to initiate data export
- `getExportStatus`: Check status of an ongoing export
- `getExportResult`: Retrieve completed export data
- `cancelExport`: Cancel an in-progress export operation

## Configuration

The export service supports configuration for:
- Default export formats
- File size limits
- Storage locations for export files
- Security settings
- Performance tuning parameters

## Security

- User authentication required for export operations
- Authorization checks to ensure users can only export data they have access to
- Secure temporary file handling
- Audit logging for export activities

## Performance Considerations

- Large exports are processed asynchronously
- Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets
- Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance
- Resource limits to prevent system overload
