# Broker Service

The core service brokering module that handles the routing and processing of requests to appropriate backend services in the Nucleus system.

## Overview

The broker service provides the central logic for the service broker system. It acts as an intermediary between the gateway and individual backend services, handling request routing, response aggregation, and service orchestration.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Service Routing**: Routes requests to the appropriate backend service based on operation type
- **Request Processing**: Validates and processes incoming requests before forwarding to services
- **Response Handling**: Aggregates and formats responses from backend services
- **Service Discovery**: Maintains registry of available backend services
- **Error Handling**: Provides consistent error handling and reporting across services
- **Logging**: Comprehensive request and response logging for monitoring and debugging

## Architecture

The broker service follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

- **BrokerServiceImpl**: Main implementation of the broker service interface
- **ServiceRegistry**: Maintains a registry of available services
- **Router**: Handles the logic for determining which service should handle a request
- **RequestProcessor**: Processes incoming requests before forwarding
- **ResponseProcessor**: Processes responses from backend services

## API

The broker service implements the core BrokeringService interface defined in the broker-service-api module and provides functionality for:

- Request routing and forwarding
- Service discovery and registration
- Request/response validation
- Error handling and reporting

## Dependencies

This module depends on:
- broker-service-api: Interface definitions
- broker-service-spi: Service Provider Interface
- Various service clients for connecting to backend services

## Configuration

The broker service requires configuration for:
- Service endpoint URLs
- Service discovery settings
- Security credentials
- Logging levels

## Deployment

The broker service is typically deployed as a Spring Boot application and should be accessible to both the gateway and backend services.
