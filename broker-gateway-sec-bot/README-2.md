# Security Bot (Sec-Bot)

The security bot module for the Nucleus system, responsible for security monitoring, threat detection, and automated security responses.

## Overview

The security bot (sec-bot) provides automated security monitoring and threat detection capabilities for the Nucleus system. It continuously monitors system activities, analyzes patterns, and responds to potential security threats according to predefined policies and rules.

## Key Features

- **Threat Detection**: Monitors system activities for suspicious patterns
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring with immediate alerts
- **Automated Response**: Executes predefined actions when threats are detected
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning for system vulnerabilities
- **Access Monitoring**: Tracks and analyzes access patterns and anomalies
- **Log Analysis**: Analyzes system logs for security-relevant events
- **Compliance Checking**: Ensures adherence to security policies and standards

## Architecture

The sec-bot includes:

- **SecurityMonitor**: Core component for monitoring system activities
- **ThreatAnalyzer**: Analyzes detected anomalies for potential threats
- **ResponseEngine**: Executes automated responses to security events
- **PolicyEngine**: Manages security policies and rules
- **AlertManager**: Handles notification and alert distribution
- **ReportGenerator**: Creates security reports and dashboards
