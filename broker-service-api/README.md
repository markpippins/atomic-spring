# Broker Service API

The API module for the broker service, containing interface definitions and shared data structures used across the Nucleus service broker system.

## Overview

This module defines the contracts and shared data types that enable communication between different components of the service broker system. It provides a stable API that allows services to interact without tight coupling.

## Key Components

- **BrokeringService Interface**: Core service interface for handling service requests
- **ServiceRequest/ServiceResponse**: Standardized request and response data structures
- **ServiceOperation Enum**: Defined operations that can be performed by services
- **Common Exceptions**: Shared exception types for error handling
- **Service Metadata**: Data structures for service registration and discovery

## Data Structures

### ServiceRequest
The standard request format used across all services, containing:
- Service identifier
- Operation to perform
- Request parameters
- Correlation ID for tracing

### ServiceResponse
The standard response format used across all services, containing:
- Operation result
- Response data (if successful)
- Error information (if failed)
- Correlation ID for tracing

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform request/response handling across services
- **Type Safety**: Provides compile-time checking of service interactions
- **Decoupling**: Allows services to evolve independently while maintaining compatibility
- **Documentation**: Serves as a specification of available services and operations

## Usage

Other modules depend on this API to interact with the broker service implementation. Services should implement the interfaces defined here to be compatible with the broker system.

## Dependencies

This module contains only interface definitions and data structures with no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency for other modules.
