# Upload Service

The file upload service module for the Nucleus system, responsible for handling file uploads, validation, and storage operations.

## Overview

The upload service provides comprehensive file upload capabilities within the Nucleus system. It manages the complete file upload lifecycle from initial upload request through validation, processing, and secure storage. The service integrates with the broker system to handle file uploads from various clients.

## Key Features

- **Secure File Upload**: Safe handling of file uploads with security validation
- **File Type Validation**: Verify file types against acceptable formats
- **Size Limit Enforcement**: Enforce configurable file size limits
- **Virus Scanning**: Integration with security systems for file scanning
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor upload progress for large files
- **Resume Support**: Ability to resume interrupted uploads
- **Storage Management**: Efficient file storage and organization
- **Metadata Handling**: Capture and store file metadata

## Architecture

The upload service includes:

- **UploadController**: REST endpoints for receiving file upload requests
- **UploadService**: Core business logic for upload operations
- **FileValidator**: Validates file content, type, and security
- **StorageManager**: Handles file storage and retrieval
- **UploadProcessor**: Manages the upload process and progress
- **MetadataExtractor**: Captures and stores file metadata

## API

The service handles requests through the broker system with operations including:

- `processFile`: Main operation to upload and process a file
- `getUploadStatus`: Check the status of an ongoing upload
- `cancelUpload`: Cancel an in-progress upload
- `getFileMetadata`: Retrieve metadata for an uploaded file
- `deleteFile`: Remove an uploaded file from storage

## Security Features

- **File Type Validation**: Checks that uploaded files match expected types
- **Malware Scanning**: Integration with security scanning tools
- **Storage Isolation**: Files stored separately from application code
- **Access Controls**: Ensures proper authorization for uploads
- **Size Limits**: Prevents denial-of-service via large file uploads
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Protects against malicious file paths

## Configuration

The upload service supports configuration for:
- Maximum file sizes
- Accepted file types and extensions
- Storage locations and paths
- Security scanning integration
- Upload timeout settings
- Temporary storage management

## Performance Considerations

- Streaming upload handling to minimize memory usage
- Asynchronous processing for large files
- Configurable chunk sizes for optimal throughput
- Parallel processing where appropriate
- Efficient temporary file cleanup

## Best Practices

- Always validate file types on the server side
- Implement proper error handling for failed uploads
- Use appropriate storage backends for scale
- Monitor upload service performance and resource usage
- Regular security scanning of uploaded files
