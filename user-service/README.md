The user management service module for the Nucleus system, responsible for handling all user-related operations including registration, authentication, and profile management.

## Overview

The user service provides comprehensive user management capabilities within the Nucleus system. It handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and all other user-related operations. The service integrates with the broker system to process user requests from various clients.

## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Create new user accounts with validation
- **Authentication**: Secure user login and credential verification
- **Profile Management**: View and update user profile information
- **User Search**: Find and retrieve user information by various criteria
- **Password Management**: Secure password updates and recovery
- **Account Security**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **User Validation**: Verify user data integrity and compliance
- **Session Management**: Handle user sessions and authentication tokens

## Architecture

The user service includes:

- **UserController**: REST endpoints for receiving user requests
- **UserService**: Core business logic for user operations
- **UserManager**: Handles user creation, updates, and management
- **AuthenticationService**: Manages user authentication processes
- **UserDataValidator**: Validates user input and data integrity
- **UserProfileService**: Manages extended user profile operations
- **UserRepository**: Handles user data persistence

## API

The service handles requests through the broker system with operations including:

- `login`: Authenticate user with credentials
- `getUserByAlias`: Retrieve user information by alias/username
- `create`: Create a new user account
- `update`: Update existing user profile information
- `validateUser`: Verify user data integrity
- `searchUsers`: Find users matching specified criteria
- `changePassword`: Update user password securely

## Security Features
