# Broker Service SPI (Service Provider Interface)

The Service Provider Interface module for the broker service, enabling extensible service implementations in the Nucleus system.

## Overview

This module defines the SPI (Service Provider Interface) that allows for pluggable and extensible service implementations within the Nucleus broker system. It enables third-party developers and system integrators to add new services without modifying the core broker code.

## Key Components

- **BrokerServiceProvider Interface**: Main SPI interface for registering new services
- **ServiceDefinition**: Data structure for defining service capabilities
- **ServiceProviderLoader**: Handles discovery and loading of service providers
- **ServiceExtensionPoint**: Extension points for customizing service behavior

## SPI Design

The SPI follows Java's Service Provider Interface pattern, allowing implementations to be discovered via `META-INF/services` files. This enables:

- **Plugin Architecture**: New services can be added by implementing the SPI
- **Runtime Discovery**: Services are discovered and registered at runtime
- **Loose Coupling**: Core broker code remains independent of specific service implementations
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new service types without modifying existing code

## Implementing Services

To implement a new service using this SPI:

1. Implement the `BrokerServiceProvider` interface
2. Create a provider configuration file at `META-INF/services/com.angrysurfer.nucleus.broker.BrokerServiceProvider`
3. Register the implementation class in the configuration file
4. Package as a JAR with the broker service on the classpath

## Use Cases

- Adding new business services without modifying core broker code
- Integrating with external systems
- Providing alternative implementations of existing services
- Creating tenant-specific service logic in multi-tenant deployments

## Dependencies

This module depends on:
- broker-service-api: For request/response data structures
- Standard Java SPI mechanisms for service discovery

## Best Practices

- Keep SPI interfaces stable to ensure backward compatibility
- Provide clear documentation for all interface methods
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Consider thread safety for service implementations
