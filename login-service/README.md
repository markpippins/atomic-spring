# Login Service

The authentication and login service module for the Nucleus system, responsible for user authentication, session management, and security validation.

## Overview

The login service provides secure user authentication functionality within the Nucleus system. It handles user credentials, validates identities, and manages authentication sessions. The service integrates with the broker system to authenticate users before they can access protected resources.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Verify user credentials against stored information
- **Session Management**: Create and manage user sessions
- **Token Generation**: Generate security tokens for authenticated users
- **Password Security**: Implement secure password handling and verification
- **Account Lockout**: Prevent brute-force attacks with account lockout mechanisms
- **Audit Logging**: Track authentication attempts and security events
- **Multi-factor Authentication Support**: Extendable framework for additional authentication factors

## Architecture

The login service includes:

- **LoginController**: REST endpoints for authentication requests
- **AuthenticationService**: Core business logic for user authentication
- **UserValidator**: Validates user credentials and permissions
- **TokenManager**: Handles security token creation and validation
- **SessionManager**: Manages active user sessions
- **SecurityProvider**: Abstracts security implementation details

## API

The service handles requests through the broker system with operations including:

- `login`: Authenticate user with credentials
- `logout`: End user session and invalidate tokens
- `validateToken`: Verify the validity of an authentication token
- `refreshToken`: Renew an expiring authentication token
- `changePassword`: Update user password securely

## Security Features

- **Secure Password Storage**: Uses bcrypt or similar for password hashing
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against authentication brute force attacks
- **Secure Token Handling**: Implements JWT or similar for secure tokens
- **Transport Security**: Enforces HTTPS for all authentication operations
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic session expiration after inactivity

## Configuration

The login service supports configuration for:
- Authentication methods and providers
- Session timeout settings
- Password complexity requirements
- Security logging levels
- Token expiration times

## Integration

The login service integrates with:
- User management system for credentials verification
- Session management for cross-service authentication
- Security audit system for tracking login events
- The broker service for request routing

## Best Practices

- All authentication requests must be made over encrypted connections
- Strong password policies should be enforced
- Regular security audits of authentication code
- Proper logging and monitoring of authentication events
